About Me

Hi! I'm Chongxiao "Shawn", a High Performance Computing enthusiast. Since 2011, I've been actively invovled into development multiple open source HPC libaries, ranging from
numerical computational library on GPU, task-based runtime library for distributed heterogeneous platform and high performance commmunication library for parallel computers.

I received my Ph.D in Computer Science in May 2017 from University of Tennessee Knoxvile, under supervision of [Dr. Jack Dongarra](http://www.netlib.org/utk/people/JackDongarra/) and [Dr. George Bosilca](http://icl.cs.utk.edu/~bosilca/).
