## Solution: ##
```cpp
/*  On position p, and p = m * n, 
    it is turned on step m, and turn off on step n.
    If p = k * k, then postion is kept on at last.
    p is perfect square number.
    We need to get number of perfect square numbers <= n.
 */

class Solution {
    public:
        int bulbSwitch(int n) {
            int res = 1;
            while (res * res <= n) ++res;
            return res - 1;
        }
};
