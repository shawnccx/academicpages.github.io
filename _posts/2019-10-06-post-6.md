## Idea: ##
- DP
- Reference: https://leetcode.com/problems/new-21-game/discuss/132334/One-Pass-DP-O(N)

## Solution: ##
```java
class Solution {
    public double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
        if (K == 0 || N >= K + W - 1) return 1;
        
        double dp[] = new double[N + 1],  Wsum = 1, res = 0;
            
        dp[0] = 1;
        /*
        The probability to get point K is
        p(K) = p(K-1) / W + p(K-2) / W + p(K-3) / W + ... p(K-W) / W
    
        let wsum = p(K-1) + p(K-2) + ... + p(K-W)
        p(K) = wsum / W
        */
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; ++i) {
            dp[i] = Wsum / W;
            // when points is less than K, all previous card could go to current i by only drawing one card
           // when points is equal to or more than K, all probability will be accumulated to results; 
            if (i < K) Wsum += dp[i]; else res += dp[i];
            
            // when i is over than W, then we need to move the window

            if (i - W >= 0) Wsum -= dp[i - W];
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
