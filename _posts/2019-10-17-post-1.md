## Idea: ##
- Queue
Playing this game is just like using a queue.
Assuming revealing results are ordered.
Number in the queue is idx of value in result.
Each step is polling queue head, for even steps, add number again into queue tail.
So, the relationship is:

When kth time revealing card:
int i = queue.poll();
res[idx] = sorted_array[k];

## Solution: ##
```java
class Solution {
    public int[] deckRevealedIncreasing(int[] deck) {
        int n = deck.length;
        Queue<Integer> fifo = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            fifo.add(i);
        }
        
        int[] res = new int[n];
        
        Arrays.sort(deck);
        
        int cnt = 0;
        int head = 0;
        
        while (head<n) {
            int i = fifo.poll();
            if (cnt%2 == 0) {
                res[i] = deck[head++];
            } else {
                fifo.add(i);
            }
            cnt++;
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```
