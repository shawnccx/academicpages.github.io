## Idea: ##
- Round one: find out the celebrity candidate: everybody knows him.
    -- Like a DFS traversal
- The first loop is to find the candidate as the author explains. In detail, suppose the candidate after the first for loop is person k, it means 0 to k-1 cannot be the celebrity, because they know a previous or current candidate. Also, since k knows no one between k+1 and n-1, k+1 to n-1 can not be the celebrity either. Therefore, k is the only possible celebrity, if there exists one.

- Round two: check whether this candidate is valid: he knows nobody else and everyone else knows him.

## Solution: ##
```cpp
// Forward declaration of the knows API.
bool knows(int a, int b);

class Solution {
public:
    int findCelebrity(int n) {        
        int res = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (res == i) {
                continue;
            }
            if (knows(res, i)) {
                res = i;
            }
        }
                
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (res == i)
                continue;
            
            if (! (!knows(res, i) && knows(i, res))) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```

```java
public class Solution extends Relation {
    public int findCelebrity(int n) {
        int cel = 0;
        
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (i==cel)
                continue;
            
            if (knows(cel, i)) {
                cel = i;;
            }
        }
        
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            if (i == cel)
                continue;
            if (!(knows(i, cel) && !knows(cel, i))) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        return cel;
    }
}
```
