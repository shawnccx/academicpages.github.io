## Idea: ##
- Using four points to record upper level head, current, and current level head, current.

## Solution: ##
```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
        void connect(TreeLinkNode *root) {
            if (root == NULL)
                return;

            TreeLinkNode* last_head = root;
            TreeLinkNode* last_current = NULL;
            TreeLinkNode* current_head = NULL;
            TreeLinkNode* current = NULL;

            while (last_head) {
                last_current = last_head;

                while (last_current) {
                    /* connect left child */
                    if (last_current->left) {
                        if (current_head == NULL) {
                            current_head = last_current->left;
                            current = current_head;
                        } else {
                            current->next =last_current->left;
                            current = current->next;
                        }
                    }

                    /* connect right child */
                    if (last_current->right) {
                        if (current_head == NULL) {
                            current_head = last_current->right;
                            current = current_head;
                        } else {
                            current->next =last_current->right;
                            current = current->next;
                        }
                    }
                    last_current = last_current->next;
                }
                last_head = current_head;
                current_head = NULL;
            }    
        }
};
```
