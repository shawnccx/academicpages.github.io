## Idea: ##
- Check 1D overlap

## Solution: ##
```java
class Solution {
    private boolean overlap(int x1, int x2, int x3, int x4) {
        if (x4 <= x1 || x2 <= x3) {
            return false;
        }
        
        if (x4 > x1) {
            return x3 < x2;
        } else {
            /* x2 >= x3 */
            return x4 > x1;
        }
    }
    
    public boolean isRectangleOverlap(int[] rec1, int[] rec2) {
        return overlap(rec1[0], rec1[2], rec2[0], rec2[2]) && overlap(rec1[1], rec1[3], rec2[1], rec2[3]);   
    }
}
```
