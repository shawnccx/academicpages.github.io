## Idea: ##
- Cyclic sort
- The meaning of i == ptn[pos[ptn[row[i]]]] is as follows:

- The person sitting at seat i has a label row[i], and we want to place him/her next to his/her partner.

- So we first find the label of his/her partner, which is given by ptn[row[i]].

- We then find the seat of his/her partner, which is given by pos[ptn[row[i]]].

- Lastly we find the seat next to his/her partner's seat, which is given by ptn[pos[ptn[row[i]]]]

## Solution: ##
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minSwapsCouples(vector<int>& row) {
        int n = row.size();
    
        vector<int> partner(n, 0);
        vector<int> pos(n, 0);
        
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            partner[i] = i%2 == 0 ? i+1 : i-1;
            pos[row[i]] = i; 
        }
        
        int res = 0;
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            for (int j = partner[pos[partner[row[i]]]]; j!=i; j=partner[pos[partner[row[i]]]]) {
                swap(row[i], row[j]);
                swap(pos[row[i]], pos[row[j]]);
			    res++;   
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
