## Idea: ##
- Using fast and slow pointer
- If there is a cycle, then fast will catch up slow at some point.
- (A+L) * 2 = A + L + nC; So, A = nC-L; A is head to cycle start, C is cycle length, L is distance from cycle head, where slow and fast meet.
- After meet, move slow to head, change slow speed == fast speed. Then next time they will meet at cycle head.

## Solution: ##
```cpp
class Solution {
    public:
        ListNode *detectCycle(ListNode *head) {
            if (head == NULL)
                return NULL;

            ListNode* slow = head;
            ListNode* fast = head;

            do {
                if(!fast->next || !fast->next->next) return NULL;

                slow = slow->next;
                fast = fast->next->next;
            } while (slow != fast);


            slow = head;
            while(slow!=fast) {
                slow = slow->next;
                fast = fast->next;
            }
            return slow;
        }
};
```
