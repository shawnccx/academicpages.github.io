## Idea: ##
- DP
- Requires recording multiple(two) statuses in DP:
- Keep[i], number of total swaps when doing no swapping at i when having valid array A[0..i] and B[0..i]
- Swap[i], number of total swaps when doing swapping at i when having valid array A[0..i] and B[0..i].

## Solution: ##
```java
class Solution {
    public int minSwap(int[] A, int[] B) {
        if (A == null || A.length == 0)
            return 0;
        
        int n = A.length;
        
        int[] keep = new int[n];
        int[] swap = new int[n];
        for (int i=0; i<n; i++) {
            keep[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            swap[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        
        
        keep[0] = 0;
        swap[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i=1; i<A.length; i++) {
            if (A[i] > A[i-1] && B[i] > B[i-1]) {
                /* Good case, no swapping needed. */
                keep[i] = keep[i-1];
                /* Swapped A[i - 1] and B[i - 1], then swap A[i] and B[i] as well*/
                swap[i] = swap[i-1]+1;
            }
            
            /* additional case */
            if (A[i] > B[i-1] && B[i] > A[i-1]) {
                /* swap A[i-1] and B[i-1], keep A[i] and B[i] */
                keep[i] = Math.min(keep[i], swap[i-1]);
                /* keep A[i-1] and B[i-1], swap A[i] and B[i] */
                swap[i] = Math.min(keep[i-1]+1, swap[i]);
            }
        }
        return Math.min(keep[n-1], swap[n-1]);
    }
}
```
