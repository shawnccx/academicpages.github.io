## Idea: ##
- Binary Search
- Original problem: divide cholocate into K+1 chunks, and return minimum sweetness.
- Re-define this problem for binary search: find a minimum sweetness l, based on that cut, upto K people can share.
- Then l-1 is the maximum of minimum sweetness allows K+1 people to share.

## Solution: ##
```java
class Solution {
public int maximizeSweetness(int[] sweetness, int K) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int v: sweetness) {
            sum += v;
        }
        if (K == 0)
            return sum;
        
        int l = 1;
        int r = sum / K;
        
        while (l < r) {
            /* with minimum sweetness mid, how many people (cnt) we can share */
            int mid = l + (r-l)/2;
            int cur = 0, cnt = 0;
            for (int v: sweetness) {
                cur += v;
                if (cur >= mid) {
                    cnt++;
                    cur = 0;
                }
            }
                        
            if (cnt <= K) {
                r = mid; 
            } else {
                l = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return l-1;
    }                   
}
```
